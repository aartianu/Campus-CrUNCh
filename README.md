# Campus-CrUNCh
# Design Document  

## Problem Statement  
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) offers a plethora of spaces for residents of Chapel Hill and students of UNC. However, these locations remain unknown, causing students to deviate to locations already swarming with students.  

During midterm and final seasons, students tend to occupy the four major study locations: **Davis Library, the Student Union, the Undergraduate Library (UL), and Wilson Library**. As a result, students make countless laps trying to find an empty spot to sit, which only cuts into their studying time. And the study spots they do manage to find are usually incredibly loud, affecting focus and inhibiting content retention.  

**Campus CrUNCh** addresses this issue by providing an **interactive map** that details all the study spots in buildings on UNC Campus. Students can browse through the study spots, finding the location closest and most suitable for them.

## Objectives and Goals  

- **Exhaustive Study Space Database:** List all of the study spaces on campus along with key attributes (proximity to power outlets, whiteboards, vending machines, bathrooms, etc.).  

- **Interactive Map Interface:** Just by clicking on a building, the user should have access to all the study spaces located within.  

- **User-Friendly Experience:** It shouldn‚Äôt take longer to access and locate a study space via Campus CrUNCh than it takes to find one without it‚Äîthe map should be reliable and intuitive to use.

## What it Is and What it Is Not  

### What it Is:  
‚úÖ An interactive map  
‚úÖ A database  
‚úÖ A filterable tool  

### What it Is Not:  
‚ùå A social platform (no communication with others)  
‚ùå A booking platform (no reservation of study spaces)  
‚ùå A real-time system (no real-time data of noise levels or crowds)

## Key Personas  

### üéì UNC Student  
- **Needs:** Find a suitable study spot in a short amount of time (should take <10 minutes to determine a desirable study spot).  
- **Pain Point:** Wasting valuable study time just to find a suitable place to sit, furthering a student‚Äôs time crunch.  

### üèõÔ∏è UNC Admin  
- **Needs:** Keep track of all the study spaces and their dispersion throughout campus to decide where and if they need to construct more.  
- **Pain Point:** Difficulty in deciding where to allocate spending in regard to study spaces.  

---

## User Stories  

- **As a UNC student,** I need to study next to a power outlet. My computer is old and loses charge quickly, so working on an assignment while also charging my computer is optimal for me. However, I don‚Äôt know what study space has power outlets.  

- **As a UNC administrator,** I need to report back to my boss the discrepancy in study spaces between South Campus and North Campus. If the results are significant, UNC might allocate funding to South Campus buildings to construct new study spaces.

## Additional Feature Idea  
üîπ **Report broken power outlet** ‚Üí Like ‚ÄúWaymo‚Äù ‚Üí Will send a ping to the hotline that fixes it.
